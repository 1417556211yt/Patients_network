# Patients_network
This is the **Patients_network** GitHub repository, dedicated to storing and sharing code for the paper *"A Cascade Model for the Robustness of Patient-Sharing Networks."* This repository includes code for model construction, data processing scripts, and visualization tools designed to simulate hospital robustness within patient-sharing networks.

At first, there are two model files that the one called **patients_flow001** is numerical simulation and the other  called **patients_flow002** is analytical model.They are the framework foundation of the model, used to simulate the patient's visit and referral process.

Then, figure 02-06 corresponds to the result graph in the literature.
